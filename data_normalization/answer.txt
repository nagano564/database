  The benefits of data normalization are searching, sorting and creating
  indexes is faster since tables are narrower and more rows fit on a data page.
  A database of customer, sales items and transactions could benefit from data
  normalization. Instead of having all of these things in one table breaking it
  down in many tables would make queries faster and less prone to mistakes.

  1NF: Each cell must be a single value. If someone buys multiple items per
  transaction each item must be it's own row.

  2NF: All attributes depend on the key. If the key is customer_id and total
  sales is listed in the same row they must be separated since the total sales
  id not dependent on the customer_id.

  3NF: All columns can be determined only by the key in the table and no other
  column. So if the table has shirt listed and shirt company list. The shirt
  since the shirt company isn't determined by the key of customer_id it needs to
  be in it's own table of CREATE TABLE company (item, company).
